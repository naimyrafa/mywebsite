  <p>During the previous academic semester, I led an industrial training session at the Tun Razak Library in Ipoh for a total of six weeks. That place has been quite beneficial for me. There are some of the Car Free Day, My Love PTR, and Hi-Tea are three of the most great events that took place during my time working at PTR, and I'd want to use this opportunity to tell everyone about it.</p>

<p>Car Free Day was one of the most important events that was organized and hosted by the Ipoh city council, and we were happy to take part in it. It is a way to encourage individuals to stop using their automobiles for a day and a great chance to minimize the amount of pollution in the air. On our end, we are required to put up an exhibition centered on independence and to conduct a number of contests, including coloring contests, crossword puzzles, word searches, and other such activities. In addition to this, we provide the participants with some interesting gifts to thank them for their participation.</p>
