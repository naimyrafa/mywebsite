  <p style="text-align: center;">I I studied Methodist Girls School (MGS) in Ipoh before moving on to finish my education at the university level. Since I was a little youngster, I have been studying at MGS. There are a lot of memories that I made with my best friends when we were still going to school there. Even though we are each focused on our respective careers, we continue to keep in touch with one another till this very day.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">From form 2 until form 5, I was an active member of the choir and the choral speaking team throughout my time in high school. We were able to compete against teams from all around the state, all the way up to the international level.</p>
